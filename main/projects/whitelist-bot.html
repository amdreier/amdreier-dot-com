            <p>
                This is a Discord Bot I wrote with a Node.js server to automate adding players to my Minecraft server's Whitelist.
            </p>
            <p>
                The motivation behind this project, was that I noticed a large number of automated Minecraft bots attempting to join my server. 
                I wanted to ensure only verified users could join my Minecraft server, but as I was at school, I didn't have much time to spend manually vetting and adding users to the server whitelist.
                This Bot allows users within the community to add their friends and people they trust to the server, without me needing to get involved.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was my introduction to Node.js as well as JavaScript as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
                It makes use of the Discord.js API to respond to commands within the server chat.
                If the command sender is using the correct channel, and has the correct permissions, the Bot makes a connection to the Minecraft server using its remote connection (RCON) interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                The user can also optionally specify the username of a user in the Discord server to add the role of 'Whitelisted' to, so that user can be identified as being whitelisted on the Minecraft server.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, the Bot will return the result of the RCON handler and the result of optionally adding the 'Whitelisted' role to the Discord user.
            </p>
            <p>
                I still have to deal with the large number of requests made to my server, which even though they're denied, can still cause issues.
                To solve this problem, I created a sign-in page, <a target='_blank' href='https://romaetplus.amdreier.com'>romaetplus.amdreier.com</a>, which you can read more about on its <a href='https://amdreier.com/projects/romaetplus-amdreier-com'>project page</a>.

            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>
                This Website acts as the sign in page to my Minecraft server, hosted at the same address. Signing in adds your IP address to 
                the list of allowed addresses which can access the server.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project works using a combination of backend technologies. The goal of this project was to give me more familiarity with tools like PHP, SQL/Databases, and Node.js
                I wanted to leverage the developer experience of Node.js, while keeping the functionality of PHP, so I decided to combine the best of both, by using PHP for the main routing and logic
                of the program, and using the Node.js servers for internal API calls and communication between servers in my network.
            </p>
            <h3>Node.js</h3>
            <p>
                I use three Node.js servers, two running on the Web server, and one on the Minecraft server:
            </p>
            <p>
                One on the Web server handles password hashing and checking, as I found this can be most safely and easily implemented in Node.js making use of the <code>'crypto'</code> library.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Node.js server on the Minecraft server handles requests to allow new IP addresses to view the Minecraft server. It only responds to requests with the correct source IP <em>and</em> correct API key.
                These credentials are stored in a separate directory on the Web server accessible to the PHP code through the <code>$_SERVER</code> variable, and in .env files for the Node.js server, accessable with the <code>'dotenv'</code> library.
                It responds to POST requests which specify an <code>IP</code> and <code>Username</code>, and executes the necessary commands to add that IP to the Firewall with access to port 25565 (Minecraft), adding a comment with the Username for clearer logging.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I have one Node.js server set up to serve content for a specific directory on the Web server, currently /node, however, this was mostly for my own learning and it doesn't server a real purpose for the project.
            </p>
            <h3>PHP</h3>
            <p>
                I use PHP with Apache to manage the main logic of the Website. I used PHP for its easy integration with Apache, which helps to enforce restrictions on directory access, and easy implementation for user sessions.
                I also wanted to ensure I had exposure to a variety of backend technologies, given PHP's continued prevalence in Web applications today.
            </p>
            <p>
                PHP is used to manage user logins, logouts, signups, and page permissions, which is made easier with PHP's native session handling and page redicrection.
                PHP also makes it easy to connect with the MySQL database I use to store user data, with prepared statements to limit the risk of SQL injection. 
                Additionally, using Apache configurations, I can store the sensitive database credentials in the <code>$_SERVER</code> variable, accessible within the PHP, but not visible in the source code.

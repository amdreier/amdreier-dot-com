            <p>
                This was my first project I worked on, before I started with my Computer Science major, just having taken a few free online courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose was to serve as a self-taught venture into GUIs with C++ and gain experience working with a GUI framework.
                I had been writing code in C and C++, but I wanted to create something more interactive and user-friendly than command-line programs.
            </p>
            <o>
                Using the Qt framework, I produced an interactive menu selection application, which I intended to be used alongside with some kind of game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking back on the code now, I see a lot of areas I would improve on if I did this project again today, and I like seeing it as a reminder of how far I've come in my understanding.

        <div class='project-description'>
            <p>
                This was a final project for an Embedded Systems class built in pairs.
                The code is entirely Bare Metal C for an Arduino, specifically the 328P Microprocessor.

                        Its main function was as a Violin-Synthesizer MIDI Controller.

                    <p>
                        The design features a neck with a location sensor (soft-membrane potentiometer) and force sensor (force-sensitive potentiometer) to take pitch and vibrato input and a joystick for pitch bend. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are eight dials (potentiometers) for adjusting different effects and operational modes, such as octave, volume, vibrato size, scale, transposition, chord type, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All analog user input from the dials, neck, and joystick are converted to digital values, using an analog multiplexer and analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) on the 328P.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We use an LCD display screen, and I wrote custom fonts and a graphics library to display notes and sensor values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One 328P controls the LCD screen, and the other takes the user input from the device and outputs it as MIDI commands to be interpreted by a MIDI speaker or processing software.
                    </p>

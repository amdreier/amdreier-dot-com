            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>
                This Website acts as the sign in page to my Minecraft server, hosted at the same address. Signing in adds your IP address to 
                the list of allowed addresses which can access the server.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project works using a combination of backend technologies. The goal of this project was to give me more familiarity with tools like PHP, SQL/Databases, and Node.js
                I wanted to leverage the developer experience of Node.js, while keeping the functionality of PHP, so I decided to combine the best of both, by using PHP for the main routing and logic
                of the program, and using the Node.js servers for internal API calls and communication between servers in my network.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifically, I use two Node.js servers, one running on the Web server, and one on the Minecraft server. 
                The one on the Web server handles password hashing and checking, as I found this can be most safely and easily implemented in Node.js making use of 'crypto' library.
                Node.js on the Minecraft server handles requests to allow new IP addresses to view the Minecraft server. 
                It responds to POST requests which specify an <code>IP</code> and <code>Username</code>, and executes the necessary commands to add that IP to the Firewall with access to port 25565 (Minecraft), commenting it with the Username for better logging.
                Additionally, I have one Node.js server set up to serve content for a specific directory, currently /node, however, this was mostly for my own learning and it doesn't server a real purpose for the project.
